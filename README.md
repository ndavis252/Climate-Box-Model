# Climate Box Model
## Description
A simplified climate box model simulating the energy balance between the Earth's surface and atmosphere using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

## Contents
This repository contains two key files:

1. PHYS 260 Final Project Write Up.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the climate box model simulation, including assumptions, equations, and results.
2. Phys 260 Poster.pdf: A poster summarizing the project, focusing on the energy balance model, simulation results, and the impact of varying atmospheric parameters on equilibrium temperatures.

## Project Overview
The model simulates the Earth's energy balance by treating the surface as a perfect blackbody and the atmosphere as an imperfect blackbody. Key parameters include the Earth's albedo and atmospheric emissivity. The model demonstrates how changes in these parameters affect the Earth's surface and atmospheric temperatures over time.

### Key Features
- Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Used to calculate radiative fluxes.
- Energy Balance Equations: Derived for equilibrium temperatures considering albedo and emissivity.
- Simulation: Shows the evolution of surface and atmospheric temperatures from initial conditions.
- Impact of CO2: Explores how increased CO2 concentrations, modeled via changes in atmospheric emissivity, affect global temperatures.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the detailed model and run simulations. Refer to the poster for a high-level summary and visual representation of the project's findings.

## Conclusion
This model provides insights into the fundamental dynamics of Earth's energy balance and the potential impacts of human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. While simplified, it serves as a useful educational tool for understanding climate change mechanisms.
